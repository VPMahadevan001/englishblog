I still remember 2023 October felt like golden days of my life.I came back
from school sir infront of T.V and watch the match. I am huge fan of virat
kohli and he is my inspiration too.It was the 13th edition of the ICC Men’s 
Cricket World Cup.
Played in One Day International (ODI) format (50 overs per side).
Host country: India — first time India hosted the entire tournament by itself.
Duration: 5 October 2023 to 19 November 2023.
Matches played across 10 venues in India.
Winner: Australia. They defeated India in the final.
Player of the Series: Virat Kohli.
Most runs: Virat Kohli (765) in the tournament.
Notable Highlights
Virat Kohli scored his 50th ODI century during the semi-final vs New Zealand.
India won 10 games in a row and lost in the final and I cried on that day and
still now I can't accept the fact that India lost that match.If I would given
a chance to revisit any of my past it would be 2023 October month.

I still remember 2023 October felt like golden days of my life.I came back
from school sir infront of T.V and watch the match. I am huge fan of virat
kohli and he is my inspiration too.It was the 13th edition of the ICC Menâ€™s 
Cricket World Cup.
Played in One Day International (ODI) format (50 overs per side).
Host country: India â€” first time India hosted the entire tournament by itself.
Duration: 5 October 2023 to 19 November 2023.
Matches played across 10 venues in India.
Winner: Australia. They defeated India in the final.
Player of the Series: Virat Kohli.
Most runs: Virat Kohli (765) in the tournament.
Notable Highlights
Virat Kohli scored his 50th ODI century during the semi-final vs New Zealand.
India won 10 games in a row and lost in the final and I cried on that day and
still now I can't accept the fact that India lost that match.If I would given
a chance to revisit any of my past it would be 2023 October month.

<p class="specialp">LAST DAY OF MY SCHOOL LIFE</p>
On last day of my school life I had physics exam.Myself and my friends came 
early in the morning to school and we talked about how we enjoyed our school
life and then our mam came and told the exam was cancelled.Myself and my 
friends were so excited and our school conducted candle prayer and our 
coordinator ravishankar sir gave last speech and the program was ended.we 
came back to class and continued talking and time went and our class mam 
came and gave her talk and finally bell rang and we all are not ready for
that.Before we wait for the same bell to ring but now it sounds hard.And
finnally I left the schoolÂ withoutÂ heart.

<p class="specialp">PUBLIC HOLIDAYS</p>
After completing all the stressful exams I was relaxed a lot and I went to 
play with my friends in the evening.I left cricket for three months which I
never did in my life.I love cricket a lot.Every day I woke up late in the 
morning and had breakfast and went to play with my friends and then I came 
afternoon to home to had my lunch and then I went to play freefire in the 
afternoon and then at 4oclock I went to play cricket with my friends and came
back to home at 7oclock and then I would complete my dinner and then I went 
to play freefire at night and returned to home at 11oclock and then I would 
watch IPL match death over and then went to sleep.That are the best days in 
my life that I would neverÂ getÂ itÂ again.

<p class="specialp">FLOOD IN TIRUNELVELI:</p>
On Sunday morning I woke late in the morning and then it looks like evening 
outside,when I went outside and see It was raining outside and I casually took 
it as normal rain and then I sat to study and in the afternoon it becomes 
heavy and for the first time I heard the news flood in Tirunelveli I was 
shocked and I didn't expect this and then holiday for school was announced and 
I was very much happy and I went out in the rain with my friends to see the 
flood in our surrounding areas and it was a lifetime experience that I would 
never forgotÂ inÂ myÂ life
